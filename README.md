# Anubadok: The Bengali Machine Translator  

[![License: GPL](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)

Anubadok is an open-source English to Bengali machine translator that uses Penn Treebank annotation system for natural language processing.

**This GitHub version is a python port of the original Perl version of Anubadok written during 2005-2008**

## Motivations  
The project began with the idea of making manual translation of PO files (Portable Object files) 
fasterâ€”essential for local language computation. 

While initially focused on PO files, its scope expanded to broader applications, such as 
translating Wikipedia content. As a Sanskrit-derived language, Bengali has structural advantages 
for machine sentence synthesis. In its feature-complete state, Anubadok can handle preliminary 
translations reasonably well, allowing volunteers to focus on manual editing.

## Architecture  
This GitHub version is Python (it was originally written in Perl). The Anubadok system uses the Penn Treebank 
annotation system for natural language processing. It supports multiple input types:  
- Plain text files  
- XML documents  
- HTML files with inline JavaScript/CSS  

Translated outputs are written as Unicode-encoded Bengali texts.

## Documentation  
- **[A Brief Introduction to Anubadok (PDF)](docs/anubadok-in-brief.pdf)**  
  Explains the internal workings and algorithms with example sentences.  
- **[Implementation Status]()**  
  Details current feature progress.  

## Running Anubadok  
Run locally without installation:  
1. Download the source code.  
2. Navigate to the package directory:  
   ```bash
   cd anubadok
   echo "I love you." | ./scripts/anubadok.py
   ```
Output will appear in Unicode Bengali.
